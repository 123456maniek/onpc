App Transport Security Settings needed by the app.

The app needs "Use Local Networking" setting since it searches media players or A/V receivers
in the local network.

The app also needs "Allow Arbitrary Loads" setting from two reasons:
- The app must connect to a media player or A/V receiver produced by Onkyo/Poineer that
doesnâ€™t support secure connections. All known devices only support HTTP.
- These devices cannot be upgraded to use secure connections since Onkyo/Poineer do not support
it in the latest firmware
