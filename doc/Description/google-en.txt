This app allows remote control of an Onkyo/Pioneer/Integra Network Player or a Network A/V Receiver via the "Integra Serial Communication Protocol". Some TEAC models like Teac NT-503 are also supported.

The two most popular features of the app are music playback and sound profile management.
This "Premium" version implements exactly the same receiver control functionality as the free version, but has more flexible user interface.
It allows to reorder the play queue using drag-and-drop, change the font and buttons size and show/hide/reorder all control elements for all tabs.

Other benefits include:
- Maximum privacy: No ads, no trackers, no telemetry, no special permissions like GPS
- The modern Material design supports different color themes and works on smartphones and/or tablets in portrait and landscape mode
- One-click access to music playback actions
- One-click access to media items using shortcuts
- Full music playback control (play, stop, pause, track up/down, time seek, repeat and random modes)
- Full tone control (listening modes, bass, center, treble and subwoofer levels)
- Enhanced Play Queue support (add, replace, remove, clear, change playback order)
- Tuneln Radio, Deezer, and Tidal streaming (if supported by receiver)
- DAB / FM / AM (if supported by receiver)
- Multi-zone support (if supported by receiver)
- Multi-room support: Allows control of groups of devices attached via FlareConnect (like Wireless Audio System NCP-302)
- Possibility to control FlareConnect without WiFi
- Control of devices attached via RI
- Display device details and control device settings such as dimmer level, digital filter, auto power, and sleep timer
