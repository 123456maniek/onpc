If a connection problem occurs:
- ensure that you use the latest firmware version on your receiver. If not, update the firmware.
- many people reports that Onkyo firmware may work unstable and the factory reset of the Onkyo 
device sometime helps. If the APP previously worked but suddenly can not connect the Onkyo device 
anymore, please performs the factory reset on the device.
- WLAN may have a huge latency and the APP may need more time to connect the Onkyo device. It it 
is possible please temporary connect your receiver to the router via cable and observe whether 
it will work more stable or not.
- If you receiver is connected to the WLAN and you use dual-band router. In the case if Onkyo 
device is a dual channel device as well, you shall be careful with the dual band configuration 
on your receiver. People report if WIFI 2.5GHz & 5GHz are configured separately (means independent 
from each other but with the same password that allows to set thoroughly the channels) the Onkyo 
device can not keep a stable connection. Please combine 2.5GHz & 5GHz channels together with only 
one password for both and set the channel width frequency to 20MHz (HT20).
